# Control_System
File - 1)Second_order_Timeresponse : -  MATLAB script analyzes a control system given a transfer function G(s) and an input response R(s). It also classifies the system response as critically damped, overdamped, underdamped, or undamped based on the roots of the characteristic equation.
File 2) signal_timescaling:-
    I've written a code that does just that. It takes your input signal, lets you specify the origin index, scaling factor (a), and shifting factor (b), and then applies the transformations.
            1️⃣ Takes your discrete-time signal as input.
            2️⃣ Allows you to specify the origin index.
            3️⃣ Takes scaling and shifting factors (a and b) as [a, b].
            4️⃣ Performs time scaling by a.
            5️⃣ Performs time shifting by b.
            6️⃣ Plots the original, scaled, and scaled+shifted signals.
